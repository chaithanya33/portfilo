containers : dockers container are light weight in system

* they will have a minimal operating system /container is 

package of application libraries and system depends

for EX: we take snapshots from vm s it has basic 1 gb or 2 gb so while consider containers it will get converted into 
MBS 500 or 600 mb depends on container  // significant size drop size of image 

* docker work flow : command
 ___containers___dockerfile__docker engine
 
_____image___agin some docker commands it make container


docker flow : 1st stage is dockerfile

              2nd     create a image /execute this image

              3rd again container 

drawbacks of docker :

docker depends on docker engine if it is fails (spof) single point of failure //containers will not responding //

to avoid single point of failures : BUILDdat is (spof ) simplecity , podman ,it will build docker images



docker daemon is heart of docker engine 

docker image is like a snapshot//with docker image they can execute create docker container without installing single dependency they can run any platform

*what is difference between docker and GitHub?
A) GitHub is a version control system to store the source code and docker is version control platform to store docker images
